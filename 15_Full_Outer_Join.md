# üß† SQL FULL OUTER JOIN 

---

## üîÑ What is an Outer Join?

Outer joins return all rows from one or both tables, even when no match exists in the other table. This differs from an `INNER JOIN`, which only returns rows where a match exists in both tables.

Three types:
- FULL OUTER JOIN
- LEFT OUTER JOIN
- RIGHT OUTER JOIN

## üîç FULL OUTER JOIN

### ‚úÖ What It Does

Returns:
- Rows that match in both tables
- Rows only in the left table
- Rows only in the right table
- Unmatched columns are filled with NULL

### üß™ Venn Diagram Analogy

Imagine a Venn diagram ‚Äî the `FULL OUTER JOIN` returns the entire diagram (both circles and their overlap).

## üìù Example Setup

**Two tables:**
- registrations: Andrew, Bob, Charlie, David
- logins: Xavier, Andrew, Yolanda, Bob

**Matching Names:**
- Present in both: Andrew, Bob
- Only in registrations: Charlie, David
- Only in logins: Xavier, Yolanda

### üßæ SQL Syntax

```sql
SELECT *
FROM registrations
FULL OUTER JOIN logins
ON registrations.name = logins.name;
```

### üß∞ Result:

| registrations.id | name    | logins.id | name    |
|-----------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| 1               | Andrew  | 2         | Andrew  |
| 2               | Bob     | 4         | Bob     |
| 3               | Charlie | NULL      | NULL    |
| 4               | David   | NULL      | NULL    |
| NULL            | NULL    | 1         | Xavier  |
| NULL            | NULL    | 3         | Yolanda |

## üîé Filtering with WHERE: Only Unmatched Rows

```sql
SELECT *
FROM registrations
FULL OUTER JOIN logins
ON registrations.name = logins.name
WHERE registrations.id IS NULL OR logins.id IS NULL;
```

This returns:
- Charlie, David (from registrations, no matching login)
- Xavier, Yolanda (from logins, no matching registration)

This is essentially the opposite of an `INNER JOIN`.

## üõ† Real-World Use Case (PGAdmin Example)

### ‚úÖ Privacy Compliance Scenario

Goal: Ensure:
- Every payment is linked to a customer
- Every customer has made at least one payment

**Step 1: Perform a FULL OUTER JOIN**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customer
FULL OUTER JOIN payment
ON customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id;
```

**Step 2: Filter to Find Violations**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customer
FULL OUTER JOIN payment
ON customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id
WHERE customer.customer_id IS NULL OR payment.payment_id IS NULL;
```

### ‚úÖ Result:
- If the result is empty ‚Üí ‚úÖ You're compliant
- If rows appear ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Data privacy issue: orphaned customer or payment

---

## ü§î Why Not Just Compare Counts?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM customer;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM payment;
```

Even if both return 599:
- It doesn't guarantee that they are the same customers
- Use `FULL OUTER JOIN + WHERE` for true validation

---

## üí° Takeaways

`FULL OUTER JOIN` is powerful when:
- You want all data, matched or unmatched
- You're doing data validation (e.g., orphaned records)
- Use NULL checks in WHERE clause to isolate unmatched rows
- It's symmetric: `A FULL OUTER JOIN B = B FULL OUTER JOIN A`
