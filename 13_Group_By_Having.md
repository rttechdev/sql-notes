# ‚úÖ SQL Notes ‚Äì GROUP BY & HAVING

---

## üîπ Aggregate Functions (without GROUP BY)

- Aggregate functions compute a single result from a set of input values:
  - `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, `COUNT()`

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM payments;
```

---

## üîπ GROUP BY

- `GROUP BY` groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.
- Typically used with aggregate functions to summarize data.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM payments
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

## üîπ WHERE vs HAVING

- `WHERE` filters rows before aggregation.
- `HAVING` filters rows after aggregation.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Why HAVING is needed:**
- You can't use `WHERE` to filter on `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, etc., because aggregation happens after `WHERE` is applied.
- Use `HAVING` to filter aggregate results.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Invalid: filtering aggregate in WHERE
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM payments
WHERE SUM(amount) > 100 -- ‚ùå Invalid
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Correct: using HAVING
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM payments
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 100; -- ‚úÖ
```

## üîπ Another Example with COUNT()

```sql
SELECT store_id, COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM customer
GROUP BY store_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 300;
```
- You can use `COUNT(*)` or `COUNT(customer_id)` ‚Äî they behave the same here.

---

## üî∏ Tips

- You can combine `WHERE` and `HAVING`:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM payments
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (184, 87, 477)
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 100;
```
